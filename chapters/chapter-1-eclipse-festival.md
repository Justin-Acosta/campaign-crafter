Adventure Chapter 1: The Eclipse Festival

I. The Adventure Hook

To the Player:
You have been invited by Avon, a powerful cleric of Lathander, to the town of Westbridge for a rare eclipse festival. In his message, Avon says that he wants help with "necrotic trouble" at the local temple of Selune in the nearby Kryptgarden Forest.

Westbridge:
This modest farming village owes its name to its simple geography: it sits on the west side of the ancient Stone Bridge. Positioned at the crossroads of the Long Road and the Stone Trail, it serves as a vital hub for local commerce. The village features a central market, a bustling stockyard, and several warehouses, all under the ownership of the enterprising halfling, Ghaliver Longstocking. Though primarily an agricultural community, many residents are skilled hunters, often venturing into the nearby Kryptgarden Forest for game. For generations, the village has hosted the Eclipse Festival, a cherished tradition honoring both Lathander and Selûne, drawing visitors from miles around.

The Kryptgarden Forest:
An ancient, sprawling woodland known for its dense, tangled woods and a reputation for being notoriously dangerous. It is home to a host of perilous creatures, most notably the ancient green dragon nicknamed "Gnawbone." The forest's shadowy depths hide forgotten ruins and the lairs of many other threats, drawing hunters and adventurers alike to its depths. Despite its many dangers, a temple of Selune was erected in this forest long ago by wood elves. In centuries since, people of all races have come to worship the moon and her light in this sacred place. Recently, there have been sightings of undead creatures in the forest. Specifically, the temple of Selune, once a safe haven in this cruel environment, has been overrun by the necrotic beings forcing many worshipers and hunters to take refuge in the town of Westbirdge.

The Festival:
The Eclipse Festival is a tradition born from desperation. Long ago, as the shadow of the great green dragon Gnawbone fell over the Kryptgarden Forest, the people of Westbridge first came together to weave a powerful ward of protection. The ritual, a delicate and potent display of celestial magic, has been performed during every eclipse since, a shield not only against the dragon's wrath but against the many dangers that have threatened the town over the years. At the festival's climax, the strongest leader from the temple of Selune and the church of Lathander share their power to preform the awe inspiring ritual.

II. The Eclipse Festival

Introductory Reading:
"This year, as the undead stir and the people drown in a palpable sense of dread, the town takes a welcome breath and loses itself in festivities. At the heart of the village square stands the Eclipse Well, a simple stone structure over which an intricate metal framework of rings and symbols has been built. When viewed from the eastern road, this device perfectly frames the sun and moon during an eclipse. For now, it serves as the festival's center. The air, usually thick with the scent of pine from the Kryptgarden, now carries the sweet aroma of honeyed cakes and roasting boar. Stalls draped in gold and silver radiate outwards from the well, where merchants from as far as Waterdeep hawk sun-stamped trinkets and moon-blessed charms. Children chase each other with faces painted like grinning suns or serene moons. By day, contests of strength and archery celebrate the might of Lathander, while by night, glowing lanterns illuminate storytellers weaving tales of Selûne's faithful battling ancient darkness. Yet, all eyes occasionally drift to the well, a silent reminder of the celestial event and the vital ritual that will soon take place around it. Tomorrow evening, the Eclipse ritual will commence"

Night Time:

Plot Event - At some point during the night's festivities, Avon, the venerable leader of Westbridge's church of Lathander, seeks out the party. He pulls them aside from the main festivities, his expression a mixture of paternal warmth and deep-seated concern. He leads to the church of Lathander, away from prying ears. He asks the party to investigate the temple once the festival concludes, emphasizing the need for discretion and caution.

Avon, the Cleric of Lathander - Avon is a man in his late fifties, with a kind, weathered face framed by short, graying hair that catches the light like spun gold. His robes are the color of a sunrise, simple yet immaculate, and he carries himself with the gentle authority of a beloved community leader. He often speaks with his hands clasped before him, only gesturing to emphasize a point of particular importance. His voice is a calm and measured baritone, but a quiet urgency enters his tone when he speaks of the temple, betraying the deep worry beneath his serene exterior.

Details:
Three tendays ago, the clergy from the temple fled to Westbirdge telling stories of the temple being overrun with undead creatures from within and a powerful. The magic users among them detected a powerful necrotic magic emanating from below the temple.
A hunting party was found near the temple road abandoned about two tendays ago, with supplies scattered about but no sign of the merchants or their guards.
He and the Selunite priestess, Elara, were childhood friends. They share a deep, mutual respect, making his concern for her and the temple deeply personal. Elara did not return from the timple with the rest of the clergy
Avon gives the party a detailed map of the Kryptgarden Forest

Reward for Help:
The Dawnray Spear: This is a +1 spear that shines with the light of the morning sun when it strikes. If this spear deals damage to a creature or object, it shines with the light of dawn in a 30ft radius, illuminating the area and deals 1d6 radiant damage to all creatures within 5ft of the creature or object it hit. When it deals damage an undead creature, it deals an additional 1d8 radiant damage.
Lathander's Boon: Avon can perform a special ritual to bestow a divine boon upon one of the party members. This character receives the ability to cast the Aid spell once, as if from a 2nd-level spell slot, without needing any components. This blessing is a direct channel of Lathander's protective power, but it is potent. This use is recharged every morning, but only if the player can see the light of dawn.
A Charter of the Dawn: For a more diplomatic reward, Avon can grant the party an official charter recognizing them as sworn friends of the Church of Lathander. This document would provide them with modest, free lodging at any of the church's temples, free healing services, and the ability gain an audience with other church leaders throughout the realm. Some other groups such as The Lord's Alliance may also make concessions for those who carry this charter.

Night Time Festival Activities:

Glimmer & Glow:
you smell the gentle scent of beeswax and see a soft, shimmering light.

The stall is run by a cheerful gnome tinkerer (Pippin) with soot-smudged cheeks and goggles pushed up on his forehead. He speaks in rapid-fire bursts of excitement about his creations, selling enchanted candles and lanterns. Some candles, when lit, release harmless, shimmering illusions of celestial creatures (a nod to Selûne), while others glow with a warm, bright light that provides the benefits of the `Light` cantrip for an hour (Lathander's blessing).

Pippin has heard rumors of exceptionally powerful creatures being found in the Kryptgarden Forest. Strangely, there was no sign of blood around these creatures even though they had clear stab and slashing wounds.

Moon-Elk Antler Toss:
A set of ghostly, shimmering antlers float in mid-air, you hear the laughter of participants as they toss glowing rings.

A graceful elf (Elara) with a silver circlet in her hair oversees the game. She moves with a quiet poise, offering a serene smile as she explains the rules. A set of ghostly, shimmering antlers from a celestial elk are set up 50 feet away, and participants are given three spectral rings to toss onto them. To make a toss, a player makes a ranged attack roll (using their Dexterity modifier). The DC to snag an antler is 15. 

If they succeed on two of the three throws, they win a small pouch of 100sp and spectral antlers sprout from their head.

Shadow Puppet Show:
You hear the gentle melody of a lute accompanying a captivating show of light and shadow on a nearby stage.

The show is put on by a single puppeteer (Silas), an enigmatic figure cloaked in dark, flowing robes that obscure their features. Their eyes seem distant and unfocused, as if watching a performance on some other, unseen stage. They use a traveling troupe of shadow puppets to tell the story of the eternal dance between Lathander and Selûne. The show is magically enhanced, with illusions that make the shadows seem to leap from the screen. Players can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check to notice a subtle, darker story being woven into the main narrative. If they succeed, read the following:

Descriptive Reading - "The puppeteer’s hands move with practiced grace, casting shadows that twist and soar. On the screen, the golden form of Lathander, the Morninglord, dances with the silvery silhouette of Selûne, the Moonmaiden. Their celestial waltz is a story of night and day, of light given and received. But as the tale unfolds, other, smaller shadows begin to intrude. You glimpse three sharp, angular shapes flickering at the edge of the screen, pulling at the threads of Lathander's golden light. For a brief moment, the music from the lute falters, hitting a discordant, sour note, and a creeping, vine-like shadow seems to wither a part of the Moonmaiden's silver glow before the puppeteer, with a slight gasp as if startled from a trance, deftly weaves the scene back into the familiar, comforting legend."

Day Time:

Ghaliver Longstocking - A gnome with a wild shock of white hair and grease-smudged cheeks, Ghaliver is a well-known and trusted artificer. Despite his eccentric mannerisms—like constantly fidgeting with a small metallic contraption and speaking in a rapid-fire, enthusiastic tone—the villagers of Westbridge rely on him to solve complex problems and manage the logistics for key goods. His eyes, magnified by a pair of thick goggles perched on his forehead, dart around with restless curiosity. His workshop, "Ghal's Gadgets," sits in the center of town, but it is closed for the festival. While he is not directly involved in the planning or celebration of the Eclipse Festival, his creations can occasionally be seen delighting travelers at the festival.

Day Time Festival Activities:

Clockwork Critter Race:
A cacophony of whirring gears and the smell of hot metal fills the air around a brightly painted race track, where tiny clockwork creations await the starting signal.

Ghaliver has set up a miniature race course where festival-goers can bet on or even pilot small, clockwork animals. The critters are whimsical and slightly unpredictable, ranging from metallic frogs that hop erratically to tiny, steam-powered birds that glide just above the track. Ghaliver excitedly commentates on the race, often tweaking a critter mid-race to "ensure a fair and exciting competition." To win the race, the player(s) must succeed on a contested Intelligence saving throw against the rest of the contestants. Before their roll, each player can make one skill check using their skill of choice to modify their clockwork animal and add their skill modifier to the Intelligence saving throw. 

A player who wins this challenge gets to keep their clockwork animal which will walk 30ft in a strait line after it is wound up and set on the ground.

Sunstone Challenge:
You hear the rhythmic chipping of stone and cheers from a small crowd gathered around a large, grey rock.

A burly human man (Borin) with a booming laugh and calloused hands runs the challenge, presenting a large, smooth, grey stone. He encourages participants with shouts of "Put your back into it!" The goal is to use a dose of holy water (provided) to reveal the "sunstone" hidden within. On their turn, a player can make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to chip away at the stone, or a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to carefully pour the holy water into the fissures. On a success, they reveal a piece of the glowing sunstone within. It takes three successful checks to fully reveal the sunstone and win a prize. 

A player who wins this challenge receives a small sunstone worth 10gp.

Sunshot Archery Contest:
You see a line of archers taking aim at targets painted with radiant suns, the twang of bowstrings echoing in the air.

The contest is overseen by a stern-faced woman (Kaelen) with a masterwork bow slung over her shoulder. She watches each participant with a hawk's eye, offering curt nods of approval for good shots and sharp, insightful critiques for poor ones. She offers three arrows to each participant. The goal is to hit the bullseye of a target 60 feet away, which is painted to look like a radiant sun. A player can make a DC 16 ranged attack roll with a bow to hit the target. Hitting the bullseye wins a prize. 

A player who wins this challenge receives 1 Arrow of Beast Slaying.

Taste of the Heavens:
You smell cinnamon and freshly baked bread from a stall displaying pastries shaped like suns and moons.

A kindly half-elf (Linden) with flour dusting his apron and a warm smile runs the stall. He takes great pride in his baking, eagerly explaining the celestial inspiration for each treat as he sells sun-shaped pastries and moon-shaped cakes. Some of the pastries are infused with a harmless, temporary magical effect. Roll a d6 to see what happens when a character eats one:
1-2: Their teeth sparkle for 10 minutes.
3-4: They can hum a perfect melody with no effort.
5: They feel a surge of warmth and gain 1 temporary hit point that they keep until they take damage.
6: Their eyes glow faintly like the moon for a minute.

Instructions:
During the festival, the leaders of the Lathanderian church and the Selunite temple are performing a joint ritual of protection over the town. What does this ritual look like? What are its components? At the peak of the eclipse and the ritual, three warlocks appear and abduct the Leader of the Church of Lathander. How do the warlocks execute the abduction? What magic do they use? What is the immediate reaction of the crowd and the remaining Selunite leader?

III. Reactive Phase: A Series of Small Objectives

Objective: Guide the players through the chaotic situation with a series of clear, manageable tasks or encounters. This provides structure to the chaos.

Instructions:
The initial investigation leads to the Temple of Selune, following up on the priest's earlier warning. Inside the temple, the party discovers several things: a nearly dead undead monstrosity, a deceased warlock, and a complex mechanical and magical device. What kind of creature is the monstrosity, and why is it near death? Is it hostile? How did the warlock die, and what clues can be found on her body, such as a note, a symbol, or her sword? What does the mechanical device look like, what school of magic does it radiate, and does it appear active, damaged, or dormant?

IV. The Climax: Confronting the Immediate Threat

Objective: Conclude the chapter with a final, decisive encounter that resolves the initial crisis.

Instructions:
The immediate threat is not a powerful boss, but the mystery of the device. The climax of this chapter is understanding its purpose. How can the party learn more about the device? Can they use Arcana or Investigation checks? Does interacting with the device trigger a trap, a message, or another event? The goal is to discover who made the device and what it's for, which will point to the next lead.

V. The Hook: Transition to Chapter 2

Objective: Provide a clear and compelling reason for the players to move on to the next stage of the adventure.

Instructions:
The party tracks down the creator of the device: a local or nearby artificer. Who is this artificer? Where do they live? Are they affiliated with the warlocks, or were they an unwitting contractor? What is their personality (e.g., eccentric genius, paranoid recluse, guilt-ridden assistant)? The artificer reveals that they built the device for the warlocks and knows their destination: another temple of Selune in a different location. Where is this new temple located? What motivation does the party have to go there (Rescue the leader, stop the warlocks, a reward from the town)?
