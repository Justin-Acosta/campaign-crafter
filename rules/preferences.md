# User Preferences and Guidelines

- Do not use markdown syntax in generated content that is intended to be copied into other documents, like Google Docs. this includes any file in the planning or chapters directory.
- To help the user develop their creative ideas, insert guiding questions directly into the campaign documents. Provide specific, actionable D&D content frameworks (like NPC templates or plot outlines) that prompt the user for details. Generate fully detailed content only when the user explicitly requests it.
- Frame rules and instructions in positive, actionable language, focusing on what to do rather than what to avoid.
- Use a paragraph structure instead of bullet points for generated content in chapter files.
- If i attach a snippet from a file and say a phrase like "modify this" or "create a summary for this section", I am referring to the attached snippet and I only want that snippet adjusted.
- When describing a character, include their appearance, mannerisms, and tone of voice.
- The `rules/context.md` file is intended to be the primary source of campaign context. It should be structured as an effective, quick-reference guide about the campaign's setting, characters, and plot.
