My Dearest Friends,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is Avon, humble servant of the Morninglord and the senior priest of the Church of Lathander here in the village of Westbridge. Though we have not had the pleasure of meeting, your reputation for courage and resourcefulness precedes you, and it is on that reputation that I now humbly rely.

A shadow has fallen upon our neighbors, the faithful of Selûne. Their sacred temple, which has stood for centuries as a beacon of hope deep within the Kryptgarden Forest, has been tainted by a creeping, necrotic trouble. The clergy has been forced to abandon their holy site, and the few who escaped speak of a chilling darkness that has taken root. The nature of this affliction is beyond my own understanding, and our local guard is not equipped to face such dangers.

This is why I turn to you. Your skills are desperately needed. I beseech you to travel to Westbridge and lend us your strength. The annual Eclipse Festival is soon to begin—a time of celebration for both our faiths. It would be the perfect occasion to meet and discuss the matter in full. Please, come with all haste. A generous reward awaits, but more importantly, you will be defending a sacred place from a growing evil.

May Lathander's light guide your path.

Faithfully,
Avon of Westbridge
